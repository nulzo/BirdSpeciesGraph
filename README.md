# :parrot: Phylogenetic Bird Species Graphical Model :parrot:


### :thinking: What is this? :thinking:
- This model is an acyclic undirected graph which demonstrates the relationality of bird species.
- This graphical model is used to depict the relationships between different species of birds, based on their evolutionary relationships, habitats, or migration patterns.
- The .py files work as a side vehicle to display information about each species. This information is contained within each node of the graph.
- The files contained within WebView provide a visual model for the graph.

### :snake: Python files :snake:
- These files, as stated above, work as a platform to instantiate a graph and traverse through it. 
- The information about each species is stored in each node.

### :computer: Web files :computer:
- These files, as stated above, work as a platform to view the graph in a 3D space by utilizing D3 js.
- Nodes with in-degrees of 0 will always be a specific bird species.
- Nodes with in-degrees > 0 will always be a class (a phylogenetic classifier) which contains species.
